# DelayAlerts
A library for scraping local news outlets to automatically determine school closures and delays on a mass scale

This is the backend for an alarm app that I was making which would wake students up at different times based on the status of school the next day.  For example a student or teacher could tell the app: "if Montgomery County Public Schools are delayed two hours tomorrow I want to be woken up at 10AM, otherwise I want to be woken up at 8AM."

I tested my scraping algorithm using historical web pages for numerous counties from web.arhive.org
